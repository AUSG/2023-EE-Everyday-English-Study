### New Expressions : 

There is only one commonality that is 'make mistakes!'. => 내가 원하는 뜻 : 한가지 공통점이 있다면 'make mistakes'한다는 것이다. 약간 이사람이 실수란 좋은 것이다 라는 것과 난 실수를 많이 한다라는 것을 재밌게 엮으려고 이 문장을 작성했다.

### => The only thing they have in common is that they 'make mistakes.'

주어를 많이 꾸며준 느낌이 든다. 나는 뒤에 목적어에 that으로 수식을 했다.

The content that i choose is named 'Write Better in English'. I choose this video because i'll read lots of english posts in the future like paper. 

Seeing this content, i was surprised because I studied opposite ways that were suggested in this video.. There are few commonalities. One of commonalities is 'make mistakes!'. And fortunately, i don't need to 'Find a writing partner' because i have writing partner in this study.

Since now, i will introduce the differences between my way and the opposite way that were suggested. First, they suggests 'Start small' but i thought lots of input comes good at english. Second, this content suggests 'Think in English'.. I thought 'how Terrible it is...'. but i will try to 'think in english'.

Thank you..!!
