### Before

The actress Min ha kim who starred in "pachinko" on apple tv plus has a good english level. she is a big fan of the lord of rings so the host ask her that how the "My Precious" is translated into Korea?. Generally we easily come up with like "나의 소중한", "나의 값진" but she told him "나의 보물". she didnt translate it literally. I can see her high sense of english. Also, Her mother let her first read the book , the lord of rings, and then see the moive. At first she read the book, It was a hard for her to understand the ancient word that is not familiar and general vocablury with her. So I felt that its important to get a change to read the book or moive by english as young as possible.

### After

Min Ha Kim, the actress who starred in "Pachinko" on Apple TV+, possesses an impressive command of the English language. She is a devoted fan of "The Lord of the Rings," and when asked by the host how to translate "My Precious" into Korean, she didn't opt for a literal translation like "나의 소중한" or "나의 값진." Instead, she elegantly chose "나의 보물," demonstrating her nuanced understanding of English.

Furthermore, her mother encouraged her to read the book "The Lord of the Rings" before watching the movie adaptation. Initially, when she delved into the book, she found it challenging to grasp the archaic words and unfamiliar vocabulary. This experience emphasized the importance of having the opportunity to read books or watch movies in - English from a young age.
