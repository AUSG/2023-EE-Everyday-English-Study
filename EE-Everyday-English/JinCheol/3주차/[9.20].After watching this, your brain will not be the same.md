### Before

ok. The speaker told us that the everything that we have done in our life make our brain structure. Namely, All of things like learning, exercising, traveling etc make our brain. So, How our brain are structured totally depends on what we do. Some people do well sking and someone is doing very well hiking. Its because they built differently their brain. and we can build our brain as the way we want. To do so, We sould have kind of mind that I never lose willing to learn new skills or area. Every experience , everything what we did, everything what we ecounterd is going to change our brain. Specially, I was impressed that the more we learn hard thins, the more our brain is getting well structured.

### After

Alright, so here's the deal. The speaker told us that everything we do in life <b>shapes</b> our brain's structure. <b>In other words</b>, things like learning, exercising, and traveling all <b>have an impact on</b> our brains. <b>Therefore</b>, the way our brains are structured depends on our actions.

Some folks are <b>great at</b> skiing, <b>While others</b> excel at hiking. It's because they've wired their brains differently through their experiences. The good news is, we can shape our brains the way we want to. To do that, we <b>need a mindset</b> that's always eager to learn new skills and explore new areas.

Every experience, everything we've done, and everything we've encountered <b>leaves its mark</b> on our brains. What's really <b>fascinating</b> is that the harder we work to learn challenging things, the more our brains develop and become well-structured.
