화자는 삶의 목적을 알기 위해 5가지에 대해서 알아야 한다고 제시한다.

1. who I am
2. what I do
3. Who I do it for
4. What they(whom I contribute to for or work for) want or need
5. how they changed

1,2번 항목은 기본적인 요소라고 하고, 주목해야 할 건 3-5번의 요소라고 한다.
3-5번의 요소를 가만히 쳐다보면 내재적인 요인보다는 외재적 요인에 집중한다.

즉, 결론적으로 행복한 사람들 (인생의 목적을 가진 사람들)은 자신이 어떻게 서비스 받을지 고민하기 보다는 타인에게 어떤 서비스를 제공해줄지에 대해 더 초점을 맞춘다.

행복한 사람들은 다른 사람들을 행복하게 만드는 것을 중요시 여기며 그들이 잘 보살핌을 받고 안정감을 느낄 수 있는 일을 한다고 한다.

상당히 신선한 접근이었다. 나의 행복은 나"만" 행복하다고 행복해지는게 아니라 내가 타인에게 어떠한 가치를 제공하는지에 따라 나의 삶의 목적과 행복을 결정할 수 있다는 것이다.

사실 모든 일이 외부적으로 향하는 영향력 없이 오로지 나를 위해서만 봉사하는 일은 존재하지 않는다고 생각한다.

내가 하는 행위는 제3자에게 반드시 영향이 가게 되있고 그러한 영향을 받은 사람들이 얻는 기쁨이 곧 나의 행복으로 연결 될 수 있다.

내가 무엇을 할 때, 혹은 사람들에게 어떤 가치를 제공해줄 때 의미있고 충만하다고 느껴지는지 고민해봐야겠다.

The Speaker suggests that we need 5 things to know the purpose of our life.

```java
1. who I am
2. what I do
3. Who I do it for
4. What they(whom I contribute to for or work for) want or need
5. how they changed
```

No 1,2 is basic things that we all alreay know, but the things that we need to focus are no 3-5.

No 3-5 is telling us we should consider outward things than intrinsic things.
In conclusion, people feeling happy with their lives are tend to foucs what they can do serve or give the value to many people and make people feel served.

Its important for people who are happy with their lives to do what other people makes happy.

It was quite impressions on me. Not only happiness is not decided by my own happy but it can depends on which value I m now serving to people.

Actually I think there is no such thing doing only for me without any influence to others.

What I am doing is necessarily affects people and the effects that poeple are feeling can leads to "my" happy.

When I am doing something, or when I provide the value with people, I should think about what I feel meaningful

### After fixing with help of GPT

The speaker suggests that <b>in order to</b> discover the purpose of one's life, one needs to consider five key elements:

<br>

Who I am: This represents your identity and self-awareness.
What I do: Refers to your actions and activities.
Who I do it for: Indicates the people or entities you serve or contribute to.
What they want or need: Represents the desires and needs of those you serve.
How they changed: Relates to the impact or changes you bring about in the lives of others.

<br>

<b>While</b> the first two elements (who you are and what you do) are considered fundamental, the speaker <b>emphasizes</b> that the real focus should be on the last three elements (who you do it for, what they want or need, and how they changed).

In essence, the speaker suggests that truly happy individuals, <b>those who</b> have found the purpose of their lives, <b>prioritize</b> serving and providing value to others <b>over</b> self-centered pursuits. They <b>derive</b> their happiness <b>from</b> making others happy and ensuring that those (who) they serve feel cared for and experience a sense of security.

This perspective offers a fresh approach, highlighting that personal happiness isn't solely determined by one's own well-being but is strongly linked to the value and service <b>one provides to others</b>.

In reality, almost every action we <b>take has an impact on</b> others, and the joy or fulfillment they experience can directly contribute to our own happiness.

Therefore, it's essential to <b>reflect on</b> what actions or contributions make me feel meaningful when considering what you do and how you serve others.
