#### [ 외우고 싶은 문장 ]

It was pretty scary at the time but looking back it was one of the best decisions I ever made.

The minute I dropped out, I could stop taking the required classes that didnt interest me, and begin dropping in on the ones that looked far more interesting.

And much of what I stumbled into by following my curiosity and intuition turned out to be priceless later on.

Believing that the dots will connect down the road will give you confidence to follow your heart even when it leads you off the well-worn path and that will make all the difference.

turned out that getting fired from Apple was the best thing that could have ever happend to me.

I m convinced that the only thing that kept me going was that I loved what I did.

the only way to be truly satisfied is to do what you belive is great work.

It made an impression on me.

Remembering that I ll be dead soon is the most important tool I ve ever encountered to help me make big choices in life.

Remembering that you are going to die is the best way I know to avoid trap of thinking you have something to lose.

Death is very likely the single best invention of LIFE.

Dont let the noises of others' opinions drown out of your own inner voice.

If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do.

놀라움의 연속이었다. 하도 유명한 연설이어서 주옥같은 애기가 많은거라고 예상은 했지만 기대 이상이었다.
아니면, 내 상황에 시기적절하게 필요한 말을 해주어서 그랬다는 생각도 든다.

매우 유명한 connected dots. 스티브 잡스는 인생의 점을 연결하라는 조언을 던진다.
내가 여기서 의미있게 생각한 점은 내 경험을 내 스스로 판단하지 말라이다.
인생을 살다보면 내 인생을 실패 혹은 성공의 이분법적 사고로 나누는 경향이 있는 것 같다.
하지만 실패가 실패가 아닐 수도 있고 그 반대 역시 성립할 것이라 믿는다.

그가 말한 것 처럼, 나의 심장을 믿고 내가 훌륭하다고 , 의미있다고 믿는것에 한발자국씩 묵묵하게 걸어나가는 태도가 제일 중요할 듯 싶다.

또한 실패가 기회가 될 수 있다는 점도 배운 것 같다. 처음 흘깃 보고 판단할 땐 실패라고 생각되지만 알고보면 다른 길로 새롭게 나아가게 만들어주는 새로운 이정표가 될수 있기 때문이다.

마지막으로, 항상 내 심장이 시키는 일을 하자. 인간이란 존재는 어차피 재로 사라질 몸이고 하루하루를 의미있고 충만하게 보내지 않으면 후회만이 남는 인생을 맞이할 것이다.

It was so full of amazing in a row(?).I somewhat anticipated that the speech was gonna gave me some "주옥같은" sotry but was so much better than I expected.

Or, It might gave me the word that I needed to hear timely on? in? my situations.

"Connected Dot" is very famous. Steve Jobs gave us advice to connect the dots.
What I think that this saying makes meaninguful is that I dont need to 판단하다 my experience just on my side.
Living life, I easily tend to divide the life just success versus fail like "이분법적으로"
but fail could be not fail(?) and I believe the opposite works.

Like what he said, the attitude tahat I follow my heart and believe what I am doing is great work and make me feel so satisfied.

Also, I leanred that fail can be another chance. At a glance, we think fail is just fail but it can leads us to new path that we didnt expect at all.

Lastly, Always do what my heart let me do (?). The Human all die and gonna be disappear being 재. if we didnt live the each day of our life with full of meaningful things, we face just regrets in our life.

"It was an amazing <b>sequence of surprises</b>. I had expected the speech <b>to be</b> full of valuable insights, <b>given its renowned reputation</b>, but it <b>exceeded my expectations.</b>

Alternatively, I thought it <b>might have been</b> great because the speech provided me with the words I needed to hear at the right time.

"Connecting the Dots" is extremely famous. Steve Jobs advises us to connect the dots in our lives. What I found meaningful here is not to <b>judge</b> my experiences <b>solely</b> by my own perspective. In life, we often have a <b>tendency</b> to <b>categorize</b> it as a binary of success or failure, but I believe that failure can be something <b>other than</b> just a failure, and <b>vice versa</b>.

As he suggested, <b>having the attitude</b> to trust my heart and believe that what I'm doing is <b>remarkable</b> and meaningful <b>seems to be</b> the most crucial.

Furthermore, I learned that failure can be an opportunity. At first glance, we may <b>perceive failure as nothing but a setback</b>, <b>but upon closer examination</b>, it can become a new signpost <b>leading us down unexpected paths.</b>

Lastly, always following what my heart tells me to do. After all, as <b>human beings</b>, our bodies will eventually turn into <b>ashes</b>, and if we don't live each day with meaning and fulfillment, we may <b>face</b> a life filled with <b>nothing but</b> regrets."
