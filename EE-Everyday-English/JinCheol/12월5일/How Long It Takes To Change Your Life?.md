### Before

1. choose not a complex behaviour but simple behaviour.
2. At least, we need 2 to 8 months to form a new habit. (not just 21 days.)
3. Dont rush yourself to be perfect.

I summarize this video with 3 sentences like this. Thie video told us that why we cant acheive the new habits to be better version of yourself and get rid of old one. The myth of 21 days is not ture. We sometimes believe that we just need 21days to get a new better habit. But this is a totally myth. The reason of this myth is spread out to the world is because it makes people belive we can get a new habit within short period. But speaker assert that we at least need 2 months to 8 months. It depneds on each person's habit, supportive environments etc. Finally, She said that if you really want to acheive a new habit, JUST DO START RIGHT NOW. and dont push yourself to be perfect. And the point is sticking to it until it will be our habit. After wathcing this video, I realize that there is no kind of "만병통치약" to be better person. and just do it is always true. very often, successuful poeple gave us insight of not thinking to much. just remind of yourself achieving of your goals.

### After

The video <b>emphasizes</b> the <b>misconception</b> surrounding the formation of new habits, debunking the widely accepted belief that it takes only 21 days. <b>According to the speaker</b>, developing a new habit requires a more realistic timeframe, <b>ranging from 2 to 8 months</b>, <b>contingent on </b> individual habits and supportive environments. The key takeaway is to start the journey immediately and avoid the pressure of <b>striving for</b> perfection. The speaker <b>underscores</b> the importance of perseverance until the desired behavior becomes <b>ingrained.</b> After watching the video, I've come to realize that there is no universal remedy for self-improvement, and the simple act of starting and persisting is often the most effective approach. Successful individuals often impart the wisdom of taking action rather than overthinking, and this resonates deeply with the essence of achieving one's goals.
