YoungHan Kim, the legendary guru of Java, said, if you want to learn about something new, then make system on your life.

The speaker of the video suggested the same way to learn a new language; having fun, doing systematically, and being patient.

I also agree with them. In these days, I used to listen the TED video on youtube on my way to work.

It is quite efficient to listen English on way to work, because I don't have to spend time planning schedule for English.

However, at first, it is hard to make a system properly, if you never make. 

So, if you want to learn something on system, you should find the garbage time in your life.

The only garbage time on the way or during a meal is available to learn something new without plan.

Also, if it is possible to add funny contents on learning, then add anything you want.

Learning something new is quite tough, so you should prepare things to make it fun.

It will make learning less difficult for you.
