YoungHan Kim, the legendary guru of Java, said, if you want to learn about something new, then make system on your life.

The speaker of the video suggested the same way to learn a new language; having fun, doing systematically, and being patient.

I also agree with them. In these days, I used to listen the TED video on youtube on my way to work.

It is quite efficient to listen English on way to work, because I don't have to spend time planning schedule for English.

However, at first, it is hard to make a system properly, if you never make. 

So, if you want to learn something on system, you should find the garbage time in your life.

The only garbage time on the way or during a meal is available to learn something new without plan.

Also, if it is possible to add funny contents on learning, then add anything you want.

Learning something new is quite tough, so you should prepare things to make it fun.

It will make learning less difficult for you.

### GPT' correction

Certainly, here's a revised version of your text with corrections and suggestions for improved clarity and coherence:

YoungHan Kim, a renowned expert in Java, once said that if you want to learn something new, you should integrate it systematically into your daily life.

Similarly, the speaker in the video advocated for the same approach to language learning: make it enjoyable, systematic, and be patient throughout the process.

I wholeheartedly agree with this sentiment. Lately, I've been listening to TED talks on YouTube during my commute to work.

This method of learning English on my way to work is quite efficient, as it eliminates the need for separate time allocation for language practice.

However, initially, setting up a proper system can be challenging if you've never done it before.

So, if you're looking to learn through a systematic approach, identify the "idle" or "wasted" time in your day.

Moments like your commute or mealtime can serve as excellent opportunities to learn something new without requiring a separate plan.

Additionally, if you can incorporate enjoyable content into your learning process, go ahead and do so.

Learning something new can be quite challenging, so it's important to make the experience as enjoyable as possible to ease the difficulty.

This will make the learning process less daunting for you.
