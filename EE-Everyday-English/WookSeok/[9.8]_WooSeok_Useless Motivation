Once I had a question that how I motivate myself at interview to get a job.

My answer was that I do not motivate myself, I just do it without motivation.

Interview told me that "So do I" with pleasure.

Plus I also agree that just doing without motivation is very productive.

However, these days I have tried to motivate myself to do more task at work.

It make my view narrow, and feel impatient.

So, I remind my answer at interview, and try to be myself without the belief that I should show something to my leader or colleague.

I hope that I recover the pure passion for engineering.
