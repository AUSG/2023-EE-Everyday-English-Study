### Reasons for choosing this content : 

In this morning, I watched video about Richard Feynman, who is the famouse Physicist.

Watching the video, I thought that I want to live like him having meaning everyday step by step.

Also he emphasize it is really important for anyone who want to be scientist to learn step by step.

I agree with him, and then I started to become interested in him.

This is the reason why I choose this video today.

But the man have, somehow, a lot of room at the bottom.

First of all, I regreted choosing this video, becasue it was full of physicistics jargon and episode that I couldn't understand.

However I could imagine what Feynman was.

He seek simplicity and funny all the time.

I think this is the reason why people love him not only as physi but also as a normal person.

Him atttitude to world include the love and peace, so everyone near him can feel it.

Actually I did in this morning too.

I used to pursue the truth and beautiful of world by studying mathematics.

He reminded me of those day.
