What is more important thing at work between freedom and fulfilment?

Maybe, you would choose freedom, because it sound boring to seek fulfilment at work.

I want to ask you one question that can make you recognize the reason why I choose fulfilment.

Where does real happiness come from?

I think true happiness comes from realizing the potential inherent in us.

So, it is more import to make fulfilment relative to freedom, because it is same with true happiness.

Everytime I start something new, I ask to myself.

Is it the thing I want to do seriously?

If it is the thing I want to do seriously, I think it is inherent in me.

This is the way I live, but I need new way to make fulfilment.

I hope that I can conceive new philosophy to live more productive.
