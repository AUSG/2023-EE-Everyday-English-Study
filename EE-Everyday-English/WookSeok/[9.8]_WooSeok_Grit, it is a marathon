"Grit is living life like it's marathon, not a sprint."

"They're much more likely to persevere when they fail, because they don't believe that failure is permanent condition."

This is the best sentences in the video, I think.

It is important to believe that you can grow more than yesterday, if you want to have grit.

Actually, being grity is quite hard, because it is hard for me to trust myself whenever I face the challenge, So I used to quite.

However, sometimes being grity is easy, if I can just do something without motivation or something like that.

Without motivation or heavy thought that I should achieve the goal, I can be more easy, and it makes me more productive.

So, I concluded that I should throw away everything except enjoy.

The more I can enjoy, the more I can be productive.

From the next monday, I will smill and enjoy learing everything I face at work sincerely.

If I can be that person, maybe my colleagues feel comfortable too.

So, Don't be worry, be happy.
