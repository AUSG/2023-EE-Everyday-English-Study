Have you experienced the failure that is close to make you give up everything? 

In my case, the kind of the failure is very hard to accept, because it is literally very hurt you, and break your heart.

However, if you succeed to accept it, then you did falling forward, not falling back.

Falling forward is better than falling back, it makes you stronger, because your eye is still watching what happen forward.

Then you can have the chance that find the answer.

Plus, if there is only 1 percentage, it could be happen.

So, just believe yourself, do not avoid the reality however it is worse, and take a risk.

This is the key to go through the failure. 

You might even fail to falling forward, but just keep going.

Even if you fail accepting failure, it's find.

Everyone suffer from this at first. 

If you just have the will to fall forward, then you are making growth.

So, just keep going, and falling forward.
