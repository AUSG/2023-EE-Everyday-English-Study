Actually, these days, I'm wondering what makes me a good person.

Because, being kind of person, I think, is very import to cooperate with other people or make a something productive.

Plus, I predict that if I can prove my sincerity by working hard, I can get more chance to grow.

However, in this video, the speaker said my thought is wrong.

People usually think of hard worker as moral, because they unconsciously are willing to choose the romantic partner for their life who can make their life more better by cooperationg.

So, many people have the kind of bias, the myth of hard working.

However, the speaker insist that we shoud get rid of that myth, and should think of produtivity as morality.

If we can, then the world will be full of productivity, but if we fail, then the world will be full of just hard working.

After watching this, I changed my mind. 

His opinion is quite convincing, and also my goal is to be productive in part too.

Anyway, the conclusion is if you want to be a good person, then be productive, not just hard work.
