### 🙋‍♀️ My review
California Governor Gavin Newsom has signed a groundbreaking law, known as the California Food Safety Act, to ban harmful food additives, including red dye No. 3, potassium bromate, brominated vegetable oil, and propylparaben. This landmark legislation, effective in 2027, prohibits the production, sale, or distribution of food products containing these additives in California. The law may influence the broader US food industry due to California's economic importance. The National Confectioners Association in Washington, DC, expressed concerns that this law could impact consumer confidence and food safety clarity and called on the FDA to provide guidance for national consistency. This legislation reflects ongoing discussions about food safety, additives, and regulatory standards.
