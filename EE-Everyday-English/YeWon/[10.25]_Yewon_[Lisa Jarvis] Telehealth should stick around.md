**REVIEW:**
The COVID-19 pandemic exacerbated mental health challenges among teenagers, but a new study shows hope in the form of expanded access through telehealth. Telehealth should continue to be integrated into mental health services for minors, ensuring it's more permanent and equitable. The pre-pandemic gap in access to mental health services for children underscores the urgency. The study by RAND Corp. reveals a significant increase in telehealth utilization among children with private insurance, but the extent of access for those with public insurance remains unclear. Despite the increase, telehealth didn't result in higher costs. For insurers, investing in mental health care is a prudent strategy with long-term benefits. Virtual appointments are as effective as in-person visits, with better patient adherence, particularly among teens. Teens are comfortable with digital interactions, making telehealth a logical choice. Moreover, it doesn't disrupt their daily routines. Parents benefit from easier participation in their children's care plans. While telehealth is advantageous, schools remain essential for identifying and treating adolescents struggling with mental health issues. Challenges include ensuring equitable access to telehealth, especially for marginalized communities. The pandemic highlighted disparities, with Black and Latinx adolescents having less access to virtual appointments than White peers. The healthcare system should strive to meet the needs of all children, irrespective of their background. Given the immense demand, telehealth should remain a crucial part of accessible mental health services.
