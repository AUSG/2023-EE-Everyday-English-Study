### üôã‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è My review
The article emphasizes the urgency of protecting coral reefs, which face threats from climate change. Rising sea temperatures and ocean acidification endanger these vital ecosystems. Traditional restoration methods are slow and costly.

Innovative approaches, like grafting coral fragments onto artificial bases, show promise. Technology, with the help of AI and robotics, can aid restoration efforts. However, challenges like delicate coral handling and high costs persist.

Coral reefs are invaluable, and global cooperation is vital for their preservation. We must explore various strategies, from coral seeding to resilient species breeding. Ultimately, saving coral reefs is a complex, collaborative effort.
