### 🙋‍♀️ My review
Google is introducing passkeys to replace traditional passwords for account and device access. Passkeys offer improved security and convenience, as users can unlock them using methods like fingerprints, face scans, or pin numbers. Google has been gradually moving towards passkeys and has now made them the primary option for password creation, aiming to phase out traditional passwords eventually. However, Google will continue to support traditional passwords for users who prefer them. Passkeys are already in use for apps like YouTube, Search, Maps, Uber, eBay, and soon WhatsApp. Tech consortium FIDO Alliance laid the groundwork for passkeys, with support from companies like Microsoft, Apple, and Google, as they work to make passkeys the standard for digital authentication. This transition reflects the industry's shift towards more secure and user-friendly authentication methods.
