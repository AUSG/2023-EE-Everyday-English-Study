**REVIEW**:
The traditional South Korean snack "yakgwa" is making a comeback, thanks to social media and the "newtro" trend, which is popular among young people. This resurgence isn't solely based on nostalgia but rather the reinterpretation of vintage and retro lifestyles. "Yak-keting," or the frantic online reservation of yakgwa snacks from popular bakeries, has become a new trend, with these snacks being sold out within minutes of being made available for reservation. Popular yakgwa brands are adding their unique touches to differentiate themselves in the market. The yakgwa craze is largely driven by younger generations who perceive it as a classy and healthy dessert that can be enjoyed in various formats. The appeal of yakgwa lies in its historical and artisanal qualities, making it a trendy treat for modern consumers.
