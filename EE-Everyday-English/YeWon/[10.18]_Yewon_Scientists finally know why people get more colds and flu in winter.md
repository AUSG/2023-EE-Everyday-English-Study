REVIEW:
This article explores the reason why people tend to get more respiratory illnesses like colds, flu, and Covid-19 during the winter months. Scientists have made a breakthrough discovery that explains this phenomenon - cold air damages the immune response occurring in the nose, making individuals more susceptible to viral infections. A drop in nasal temperature of as little as 9 degrees Fahrenheit can reduce the effectiveness of billions of immune cells and viruses in the nostrils by nearly 50%. This revelation highlights the importance of maintaining a warm intranasal environment, which can be achieved by wearing masks during cold weather. The study also opens doors for potential topical nasal medications that enhance the body's natural defenses against respiratory infections.
