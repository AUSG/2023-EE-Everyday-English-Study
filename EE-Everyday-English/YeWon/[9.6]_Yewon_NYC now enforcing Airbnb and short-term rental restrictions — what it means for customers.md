### 🙋‍♀️ My review
I understand that New York City is facing challenges related to housing availability and the need to protect residential neighborhoods. However, I find myself leaning towards an opposing viewpoint when it comes to the strict regulations on short-term rentals.

While I acknowledge the concerns about housing scarcity and maintaining the local community's character, I believe these regulations may stifle the choices available to travelers and negatively impact small businesses that depend on tourism income. Requiring hosts to be physically present during guests' stays, although intended for safety reasons, might deter those seeking privacy and independence during their visits.
I think there could be more balanced solutions that allow both residents and tourists to coexist harmoniously. Overly restrictive regulations may deter travelers from choosing New York City as their destination, potentially harming the vibrant hospitality industry that contributes to the city's economic growth. In my opinion, finding a middle ground between regulating short-term rentals and encouraging tourism is essential. Other cities worldwide might look at New York City's approach as a precedent, making it crucial to consider the broader implications of these regulations. While I respect the city's aim to protect residents' rights, I hope that there can be a more flexible and accommodating approach to this complex issue.
