### 🙋‍♀️ My review
The article discusses the rising COVID-19 cases as students return to school and employees go back to offices. This situation raises questions about how prepared we are for another health crisis.

In 2020, many businesses were caught off guard when the pandemic hit. They had to make quick decisions that affected their profits and employees' safety. Some switched to remote work, and some closed their physical stores.

Now, businesses are concerned about whether employees will want to return to the office and if people will stop visiting physical stores, restaurants, and hotels. The good news is that we have learned a lot from dealing with the pandemic for over three years. We have tools to handle COVID-19 better.

Businesses have adapted to working in different disease environments and have put remote-work policies and crisis-operational plans in place. This means they can adapt more easily to changes in rules and policies.

However, not everyone will be affected the same way. Workers who need to be on-site might face more challenges and burnout.

In conclusion, we have learned a lot, but each business and its leaders must stay updated and make the right decisions as the situation changes. We must adapt to new challenges, whether they're related to COVID-19 or other issues.
