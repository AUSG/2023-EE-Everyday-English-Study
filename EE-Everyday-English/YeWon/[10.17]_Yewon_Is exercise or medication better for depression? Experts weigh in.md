### 🙋‍♀️ My review
I found this article intriguing as it explores the effectiveness of exercise, specifically running, in treating depression and anxiety. It's remarkable that research suggests running can be as beneficial as antidepressants for some individuals. The emphasis on personalized treatment plans is crucial since depression severity and personal preferences vary widely. 

The idea that exercise can improve not only mental health but also physical well-being is encouraging. However, it's important to acknowledge that there isn't a one-size-fits-all solution, and both exercise and medication have their merits and limitations. 

The study's finding that some participants preferred running over medication due to its positive physical health effects raises interesting questions about the mind-body connection. This highlights the need for a comprehensive approach to mental health treatment that considers individual needs and preferences. 

Overall, this article underscores the significance of options and personalized care when addressing depression and anxiety. It promotes the idea that physical activity, such as running, can play a substantial role in enhancing one's mental and physical health, offering a ray of hope to those seeking alternatives to traditional medication-based treatments.
