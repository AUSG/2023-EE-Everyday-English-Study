### 🙋‍♀️ My review

As a senior of computer science student preparing to become a developer, I found this article particularly intriguing. It's fascinating to see how the role of programming is evolving with the advancement of AI. I agree that AI-powered tools are becoming increasingly important, and they have the potential to make programming more accessible. The idea of programming becoming more user-friendly and less reliant on learning complex languages is exciting. I can't help but wonder how this change will impact the job market for programmers in the future. The concept of AI-generated programs is intriguing, and I believe it could lead to increased productivity and innovation. GitHub's survey results, showing that AI coding assistants reduce frustration and improve productivity, are encouraging. It's interesting to think about how coding as a skill might become less specialized and more widespread. 

I can relate to the author's concerns about introducing coding to the next generation, as it's something I'm passionate about as well. However, it's reassuring to know that coding skills might not be as essential in the future as they are today. Overall, I'm excited about the potential opportunities AI offers for the tech industry, but I also understand the need for adaptability and continuous learning. This article gave me valuable insights into the evolving future of programming, and I'm eager to see how the future unfolds.
