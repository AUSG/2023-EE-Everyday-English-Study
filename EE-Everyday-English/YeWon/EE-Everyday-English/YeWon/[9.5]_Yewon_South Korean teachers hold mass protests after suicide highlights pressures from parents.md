### 🙋‍♀️ My review

I'm deeply concerned about the challenges faced by teachers in South Korea. The child abuse law, intended to protect children, seems to have unintended consequences, leaving educators vulnerable to unfair accusations. It's disheartening to hear about the high rate of teacher suicides, reflecting broader mental health issues in South Korea. The decline in job satisfaction among teachers and the impact on their mental well-being is alarming.

This situation highlights the need for significant changes in South Korea's education system and child abuse laws. It's crucial to ensure teachers' rights are protected, and they can perform their roles without fear of retribution. Additionally, the immense pressure on students and the exorbitant spending on private education are concerning societal issues that need to be addressed. I think we must prioritize the well-being of educators and students alike. It's essential to reform the child abuse law to prevent its misuse and protect teachers from undue harassment. Moreover, the government should address the root causes of stress in the education system and promote a healthier learning environment. Furthermore, building open communication between teachers, students, and parents is crucial in resolving disputes and reducing the burden on educators.
