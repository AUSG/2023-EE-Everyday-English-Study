### 🙋‍♀️ My review
The article discusses the high inflation rate in the UK, which has slightly decreased to 6.7%. This remains a significant concern for the economy. The Bank of England has raised interest rates 14 times to combat inflation, but it's still above the 2% target. Inflation is primarily driven by rising food and energy prices, impacting consumers' purchasing power. It's essential for the government and central bank to work together to address this issue. While some workers have seen wage increases, many are struggling with smaller pay raises, leading to concerns about affordability. Lowering inflation is crucial to maintaining the value of people's hard-earned money. The Bank of England predicts a drop to 5% by the end of 2023, but it's been more persistent than expected. A coordinated effort is needed to ensure incomes keep pace with the rising cost of living.

In conclusion, a coordinated effort between the government and the central bank is important to address this issue and ensure that incomes keep pace with the rising cost of living.
