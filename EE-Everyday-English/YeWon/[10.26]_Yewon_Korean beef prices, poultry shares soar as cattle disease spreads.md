REVIEW:
The outbreak of lumpy skin disease in cattle in South Korea has led to a rise in the prices of Korean beef. Wholesale prices have increased by 6.5% compared to the pre-outbreak prices, reaching an average of 19,365 won ($14.25) per kilogram as of Wednesday. Retail prices for first-grade Korean beef also saw a 7.8% increase. The rise in prices is attributed to delays in transporting cows to slaughterhouses, which resulted from quarantines imposed near cattle farms. As a result of the outbreak, stocks of poultry sellers, considered an alternative to beef, surged, with companies like Foodnamoo and Maniker seeing significant stock price increases.
