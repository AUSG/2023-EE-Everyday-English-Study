### 🙋‍♀️ My review
The article explores Japan's strategies for coping with extreme heat, which I found both relevant and intriguing. It's fascinating to witness the harmonious blend of Japanese traditions and modern innovations when it comes to combating the sweltering weather. The concept of mono no aware, emphasizing the transient beauty of all things, particularly resonated with me. Opting for loose clothing as a means to stay cool while adhering to conservative fashion norms is a clever adaptation. I was intrigued by the idea of jackets equipped with built-in fans, which can create a closed-loop system of coolness on hot days. Pocari Sweat and salt plum candies sound like refreshing solutions for staying hydrated and replenishing sodium levels. Discovering Japanese vocabulary related to heat was enlightening and reflective of the culture's deep connection with seasonal changes. 

The practice of sprinkling water on streets as an ancient way to cool the ambient air temperature intrigued me, and I wondered if it could be adopted in other places. Additionally, the popularity of horror films during the summer in Japan is an intriguing cultural aspect. 

Lastly, aligning food choices with the weather, such as consuming spicy foods to cool down, seems like a practical approach. In sum, Japan's approach to dealing with extreme heat appears impressive and adaptable, offering potential insights for addressing similar challenges elsewhere.
