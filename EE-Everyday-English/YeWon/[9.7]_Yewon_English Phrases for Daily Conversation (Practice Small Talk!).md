### 🙋‍♀️ My review
I chose this video because I wanted to learn English phrases used in everyday life, and it has been very helpful. I liked that it covered various themes such as work-related conversations, weather, leisure time, and conversations related to hobbies. One theme that particularly stood out to me was the phrases related to leisure time and hobbies. For example, asking if someone has plans for the weekend. I used to always ask, "Do you have any plans for the weekend?" However, in the video, they introduced new expressions like "Have got much planned for the weekend?" and "What did you get up to over the weekend?" 

I appreciated being able to learn a variety of everyday phrases naturally through this video. I would highly recommend this video to my fellow study group members. It's an excellent resource for anyone looking to enhance their understanding of everyday English phrases. The diverse range of topics covered ensures that everyone can benefit from it!
