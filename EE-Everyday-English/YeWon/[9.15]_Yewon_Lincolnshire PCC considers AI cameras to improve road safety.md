### 🙋‍♀️ My review
Traffic safety is a critical concern in today's world, and the use of AI-equipped cameras to monitor road behavior is a promising step forward. Lincolnshire's initiative to explore this technology is commendable, especially as it has already shown success in other regions like Devon and Cornwall.

The summit's focus on sharing best practices is a smart approach to address this issue collectively. It's clear that despite efforts to improve road safety, there are still tragic incidents occurring, emphasizing the need for more effective measures. The AI cameras' ability to catch distracted drivers is impressive and can deter risky behavior.

Additionally, the grants for community road safety improvements in Northamptonshire sound like a proactive way to involve local residents in the cause. The "Vision Zero" strategy, inspired by Sweden's success, holds great potential to reduce road fatalities. Unnecessary road deaths should never be accepted, and events like this summit provide valuable learning opportunities.

Overall, enhancing road safety should remain a top priority for communities everywhere.
