REVIEW:
The growing number of young unemployed Koreans who have been jobless for extended periods is a concerning issue. It's evident that some individuals are giving up on job searching due to various factors, and the influence of genetics on career choices is a fascinating aspect of this problem. The decline in economically active young people, despite overall employment growth, highlights the severity of the issue. The implications of this trend extend beyond the labor market, affecting marriage rates and fertility, leading to concerns about the future population. Economic instability, especially for men, is a significant barrier to marriage, and it's apparent that many young adults continue to live with their parents due to financial uncertainties. The rising number of reclusive youths is a troubling aspect, as many are isolated due to the challenges they face in seeking employment. The government and local authorities are implementing various measures to address these problems, such as providing financial support and job counseling. However, experts stress that the fundamental solution lies in creating stable and well-paying job opportunities. The need for a flexible labor market and support for non-regular workers is essential to adapt to changing job trends and improve the overall job market.
