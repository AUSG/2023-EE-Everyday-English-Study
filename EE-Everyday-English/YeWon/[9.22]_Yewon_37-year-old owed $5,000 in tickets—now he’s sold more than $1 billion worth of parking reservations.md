### 🙋‍♀️ My review
This article highlights the journey of Mark Lawrence and his creation, SpotHero, which revolutionized parking in urban areas. It's inspiring to see how a frustrating personal experience led to the development of a successful business. The concept of using technology to streamline parking reservations is brilliant and has clearly filled a significant need in the market. Lawrence's determination and willingness to adapt when faced with challenges, like transitioning from private spots to partnerships with parking garages, demonstrate the qualities of a successful entrepreneur. The growth of SpotHero from a small startup to a company generating substantial revenue and attracting investment is remarkable. 

I find it interesting how technology is transforming traditional industries like parking management. SpotHero's goal of digitizing a larger portion of the parking market shows their ambition and potential for further growth. It's a reminder that economic crises can sometimes lead to unexpected opportunities, and seizing them can result in great success. Overall, SpotHero's story is a testament to innovation and entrepreneurship.
