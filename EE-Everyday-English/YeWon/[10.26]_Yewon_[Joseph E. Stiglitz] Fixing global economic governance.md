**REVIEW:**
The recent IMF and World Bank meetings revealed glaring shortcomings in global leadership and institutional arrangements. Although the World Bank aims to address climate change, economic growth challenges, and poverty policies, its lending capacity falls far short of what the world needs. Scaling up private capital through de-risking initiatives for projects in poor countries has been a central topic. However, relying on the private sector to solve the long-term public goods problem of climate change is not realistic, as the private sector typically prioritizes proprietary gains over social benefits. The solution may lie in strengthening multilateral development banks, mobilizing resources from developed countries, and changing international agreements to provide developing countries with the necessary resources to address climate change, public health, and the Sustainable Development Goals.
