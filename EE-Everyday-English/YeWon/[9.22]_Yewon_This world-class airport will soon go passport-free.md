### 🙋‍♀️ My review
Starting in 2024, Singapore's Changi Airport will introduce a passport-free immigration system using biometric data like facial recognition. 
This innovative approach makes Singapore one of the first countries globally to implement such a system. Changi Airport already uses facial recognition to some extent, but these upcoming changes aim to streamline the entire travel process. Passengers will have a single digital ID that they can use for various tasks, such as checking luggage and boarding flights, making travel more convenient. However, it's essential to remember that passports will still be necessary for entry into many countries outside of Singapore. Changi Airport, known as one of the world's best and busiest airports, recently saw over 5 million passengers in June, marking a recovery from pandemic-related challenges. It's expanding to accommodate even more travelers, and the new biometric system aims to enhance efficiency and security while maintaining privacy.
