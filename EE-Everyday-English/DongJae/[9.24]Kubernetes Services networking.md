# Kubernetes Services networking

the details depend on which CNI plug-in is being used.
to learn more you can check out the other videos in this series to understand how things fit together across a range of different networking options

ClusterIP is a virtual IP address used to represent a service
kube proxy programs the linux kernel to intercept connections to cluster IPs and LB across the pods back in each service
for example, service 1 is backed by pods A and C.
then when pod D tries to connect to the services cluster IP
the connection is intercepted
and using a technique called mapped network address translation
the destination IP is changed from the cluster IP to the chosen backing pods IP address
importantly the source IP address is not changed
so pod A sees pod D as the source of the connection.
and any network policies they apply to pod A behave exactly as expected
the return traffic associated with connection gets the nat reversed on its way back
client part is unaware any of this happend

but if only the destication was mapped, they return packets from port on other nodes would go directly back to the client which wouldnt know what to do with the packets because they arent coming from the node and they probably thought it was connecting to.
So calico handle this.
