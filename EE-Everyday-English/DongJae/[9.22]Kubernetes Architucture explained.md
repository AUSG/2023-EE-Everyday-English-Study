## Summary

The kubelet interacts with both containers and the node.
It initiates the pod which contains a container inside.
Each node communicates with services, such as a load balancer.
kube-proxy forwards the requests.
Every worker node should have kubelet, kube-proxy, and a container runtime.
The API server serves as the gateway for the cluster.
The scheduler determines on which node a new pod should be scheduled.
The controller manager detects changes in the cluster state.
etcd acts as the brain of the cluster.
The master node houses the API server, scheduler, controller manager, and etcd.
