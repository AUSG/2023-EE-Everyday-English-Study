### `in the comfort of` vs `from the comfort of`

- in the comfort of : 편안한 장소에서 무언가를 할 때 사용

(ex. I like to read in the comfort of my bed.)

- from the comfort of : 편안한 장소에서 원격으로 무언가를 할 때 사용

(ex. You can watch the concert from the comfort of your home.

You can order food from the comfort of your own home.)

### dawn on own
`무언가가 (누군가에게) 점차 확실해지다` or `누군가가 무언가를 갑자기 깨닫다`

This video say the traits of polyglots, as realized through conversations with them.
The common traits among polyglots is that they enjoy learning new langauge.
They have different ways of enjoying it, but anyway, they all enjoy learning new language.
Though they have different ways, but each has own's effective way.
And they have their own systematic way.
They achieve this through their effort.
I think learning new language is fun too.
Just talking to native speakers is fun, even im not good at english.
But i can not do it well because of shame about my pool english ability.
I have not made effort, so my english ability has not improved.
The different between polyglots and me is effort. I have to work hard.
