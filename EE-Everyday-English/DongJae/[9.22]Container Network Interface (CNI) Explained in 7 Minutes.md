## Summary

CNI stands for Container Network Interface.
A CR (Container Runtime) must create a network namespace.

The container runtime invokes the network plugin when a container is added.
The container runtime invokes the network plugin when a container is deleted.
The network configuration is in JSON format.
The plugin must support command-line arguments like "add", "del", and "check".

The plugin is responsible for IP address assignment to pods.
The plugin should return results in a specific format.
