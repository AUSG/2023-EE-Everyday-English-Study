## summary

after we hang out at the first time, I thought it is better that I know more expression about offering opinion.
this video let me know a lot of useful expression that i can use when talk to someone about one's opinion.
first expression is 'Fair enough.' It means that 'of course, I understand your opinion, but...'
seccond is 'Do you know what i think'. It can be used when before starting offering my opinion.
third expression is 'in my opnion'. it means literally.
fourth, 'hear me out'. it has a similar meaning to 'plz listen to me,...'
and other is 'in my humble opinion', 'frankly', 'it seems to me', 'the way i see it'.
and the last expression is a 'i take your point'. it means 'I understand what you're saying, but...'

i will prepare these expression in my life. and i will be an great english speaker.

Of course! Here's a slightly revised version of what you wrote, keeping it conversational:

After hanging out for the first time, I realized I wanted to know more expressions about offering opinions. This video taught me a lot of useful phrases I can use when discussing someone's opinion.

First, there's "Fair enough." It's like saying, "I get where you're coming from, but..."
Second is "Do you know what I think?" I can use this before sharing my thoughts.
Then there's the straightforward "in my opinion."
Fourth, "hear me out," which is kinda like saying, "please listen to what I have to say..."
Some others include "in my humble opinion," "frankly," "it seems to me," and "the way I see it."
And the last one is "I take your point," which is a way to say "I get what you're saying, but..."

I'll start using these expressions more. Soon, I'll be a great English speaker!
