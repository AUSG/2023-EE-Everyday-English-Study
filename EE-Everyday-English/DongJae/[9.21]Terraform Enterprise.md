## summary

I used terraform a little bit.
And I, curious about how to make good tf code.
Because terraform code is little difference with other common code.
So I couldnt apply my origin knowledge.
It is the reason that I watch this video.
This Video said that we can modulize terraform code.
terraform code can be divided by some part.
For example, network, cloud policy, db, app... anyway.
we can divide code and connect with api.
then we can avoid monolithic terraform code.
