Actually, when I first started watching this video, I thought it was about "the way of thinking in English."
but it wasn't.
The video discussed the interesting idea that one's thinking can differ depending on the language they use.
For example, if one breaks their arm in an accident, in English, one might say, "I broke my arm."
However, Koreans wouldn't phrase it that way.
They would likely say, "My arm was broken."
By saying it this way, Koreans can effectively convey that the arm was broken due to an accident.
But in English, they really focus on who did it.
So, people who speak different languages might remember the same thing differently.
Similarly, if there were no words for numbers like 7, 8, or 9, it would be challenging to compare quantities.
The same concept applies to colors.
In different languages, we have different ways to name colors, so people might see colors in their own way.
This made me think of a part in the book 'Sapiens' where it talked about how when language came around, our thinking and memory really leveled up
