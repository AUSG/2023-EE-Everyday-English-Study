Today, fully learning assembly is a waste of time.
However, it's necessary to have a basic understanding of how assembly operates.
There are benefits to learning assembly.

First, the reasons are similar to why we study CS.
Even if we don't build computers, knowing how they are structured and operate aids in programming. It provides a solid basis for gauging performance and enables us to write efficient code.

Second, occasionally, understanding assembly might be the only way to identify a problem.
While such situations are not common these days, there are instances where knowledge of assembly can be essential.
There's no need to become an expert in assembly, but having a basic understanding can be helpful.
