This video explains how to start a presentation. Many people mention the subject of their presentation. But the most interesting thing is why you're presenting on that topic. So it's better to talk about the 'why' or the goal of your presentation. Before, I'd never thought about it. I just tried to convey the content well. But from now on, I'll try to attract attention by giving a reason why I'm presenting on it.
