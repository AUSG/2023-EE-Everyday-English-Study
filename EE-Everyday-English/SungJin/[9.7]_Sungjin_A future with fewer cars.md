Cars put smog in the air, create traffic and congestion, and cause accidents. The speaker hoped for a future with fewer cars. He said that mostly smart EVs and cars that can do more for us. Governments accross the world are committing to change the way we move, and EVs are at the center of this change. Today, most of the cars powered by engine or battery are not truly smart vehicles. His company with his partners, has created an autonomous valet parking system. It's already in our production car. He insisted that In just five to ten years, the car won't even need to parking lot. It will be driving other people around on a car-sharing platform. When this is the case, we don't need so many cars on the road.
